[ ] improve video resize quality (compare to vlc eg)


[ ] load random url vid if internet, otherwise none


[x] make loading anim frame rate independent



[ ] test loading urls with no internet


[x] set notification popup and window title to video name



[ ] debug and release build folders?

[ ] alt tab should close the menu probably [didn't work on menu from sys tray]



[x] command line options
    [x] menu options
    [ ] positioning/sizing options

[ ] overlay display: play/pause feedback, etc


[x] load urls with timestamps
[x] copy url to clipboard with timestamp


[ ] percent bar incorrect when seeking some urls?
    [ ] which?




[ ] seems like mem leak on loading files


[ ] needs a few abstraction cleanup passes
    [ ] menu windows
    [ ] wallpaper window?
    [ ] app/plat interface?
    [ ] app/plat inter thread communication
    [ ] a sort of message system for update loop communication? load video, seek, etc


[ ] decouple display from frames decoded so we can decode from network easier? 
    [ ] with caching
    [ ] and buffering

[ ] look into how ffmpeg dls videos -- cache anywhere?

[ ] need to dl a low quality version first or we'll lag on large files??
    (definite delay but maybe not correlated to vid size)



[ ] more than one audio stream
    [ ] give us a message if we ever see this



---intermittent bugs---


[?] menu hiding but submenu not if submenu off main window
    hiding submenu when closing menu now, keep eye out for this

[ ] menu bar not hiding when mouse stays still (flickers off then on)

[ ] video was paused when unfullscreening and could not be unpaused again 
    (like it was ignoring single clicks)
    happened when unfullscreening a very vertical video.. maybe second click was off window or something?
    seems to happen when switching a lot between fullscreen via double 
    [ ] debug display state [viewing mouse flags would probably fix this quickly]



---low priority----


[ ] opacity doesn't seem to work in wallpaper mode, but not really wanted too badly anyway
    could maybe do something funny with workerW to get it to work, 
    since workerW is originally for fading between wallpapers

[/] extra bar on right of some vids
    -fixed but only by using a constant-size buffer

[/] lose transparency on full screen
    -temp workaround by keeping 1 pixel smaller than monitor size

[?] more than one video stream??
    [ ] just get a big collection of different videos to test at some point


[/] window controls are laggy on second ghoster window
    this is starting to feel like an nvidia driver bug
    [x] .bat file workaround
    [ ] "launcher" exe workaround?



---consider-----

step forward and backwards by a single frame?


manual crop by resize borders but keeping window same? 
maybe with middle mouse button


when playing url...
..d/l asyn high quality
..play low quality instantly, switching to high quality on the fly?


replace youtube-dl with homegrown/internal variant?

grown/shrink which side of window based on screen location when changing aspect ratio??


hide/show menu window instead of creating and destroying?


add icon to pause/play menu item


---instructions-------

to load a file

pass path as argument
drag file onto window
drag url onto window
paste (ctrl+V) url or path from clipboard while window active
rclick menu, paste url or path
rclick menu, open file... ?



---notes---


debug print these cases--
PTS out of order
any b frames?
repeat_pict?


use avframe repeat_pict ?




fluid buffering----

[xxx        ] time playing
[.....      ] time buffered

two threads 
-1 getting video quickly as possible given what we have and time until we run out
-1 grabbing highest res frame avil for next frame, buffer if none avail


i/o loop
-fast, responsive
-no drops
-animate if waiting for data


d/l / decode loop
-get data asap, even if low qual
-improve qual asap
-ok to wait, esp if video playing, but w/in reason (timeout?)



---fun----

preview random frame when loading while paused

filters!

random a/v mashup

random video [maybe 'i'm feeling lucky' style]

green screen masking type functionality?

if no video, visualize audio
