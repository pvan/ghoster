[ ] hide/show menu window instead of creating and destroying?


[ ] transparency slider

[ ] command line options


[ ] load urls with timestamps
[ ] copy url to clipboard with timestamp


[ ] percent bar incorrect when seeking some urls?


[/] proper fullscreen/pause/unpause behavior
    [x] cache state on first click
    [ ] should compromise and pause, like, halfway through our allowed double click time


[ ] a sort of message system for update loop communication? load video, seek, etc


[/] extra bar on right of some vids
    -fixed but only by using a constant-size buffer

[/] lose transparency on full screen
    -temp workaround by keeping 1 pixel smaller than monitor size


[ ] seems like mem leak on loading files


[ ] needs a few abstraction cleanup passes


[ ] decouple display from frames decoded so we can decode from network easier? 
    [ ] with caching
    [ ] and buffering

[ ] look into how ffmpeg dls videos -- cache anywhere?

[ ] need to dl a low quality version first or we'll lag on large files??
    (definite delay but maybe not correlated to vid size)


[ ] overlay display: play/pause feedback, etc



[ ] add black bars when aspect ratio is locked and full screen



[ ] more than one audio stream
[?] more than one video stream??



[ ] volume! 


[ ] transparency slider



---consider-----

step forward and backwards by a single frame?


manual crop by resize borders but keeping window same? 
maybe with middle mouse button


when playing url...
..d/l asyn high quality
..play low quality instantly, switching to high quality on the fly?


replace youtube-dl with homegrown/internal variant?

grown/shrink which side of window based on screen location when changing aspect ratio??



---instructions-------

to load a file

pass path as argument
drag file onto window
drag url onto window
paste (ctrl+V) url or path from clipboard while window active
rclick menu, paste url or path
rclick menu, open file... ?



---notes---


debug print these cases--
PTS out of order
any b frames?
repeat_pict?


use avframe repeat_pict ?




fluid buffering----

[xxx        ] time playing
[.....      ] time buffered

two threads 
-1 getting video quickly as possible given what we have and time until we run out
-1 grabbing highest res frame avil for next frame, buffer if none avail


i/o loop
-fast, responsive
-no drops
-animate if waiting for data


d/l / decode loop
-get data asap, even if low qual
-improve qual asap
-ok to wait, esp if video playing, but w/in reason (timeout?)



---fun----

preview random frame when loading while paused

filters!

random a/v mashup

random video [maybe 'i'm feeling lucky' style]
