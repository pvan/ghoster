before done enough to use:

[ ] weird bug after ctrl alt delete

[ ] add debug text from projector

[ ] sync system render loop to decoding loop

[ ] figure out extra bar on right since allowing resize ffmpeg buffer 
    [wrong res in file? padded alloc?]

[ ] loaded video using wrong aspect ratio?? happened with manups but can't repeat

[ ] resize before done loading, window disappears

[ ] intermittent progress bar not hiding when mouse is still [need last mouse move ms displayed]

[ ] don't let failed load attempt cancel a previous but good load attempt

[ ] black bar when loading new video is different size 
    (window resized before display buffer i guess)

[ ] test files with just audio or just video



before done enough for this dev cycle:

[ ] add option to overflow screen edges instead of just letterbox
    -maybe allow letterbox/overflow in windowed mode too?

[ ] drag drop onto sys tray icon?

[ ] since slow seek on urls, the "slow" doubleclick to fullscreen feels pretty bad
    [ ] don't save/restore vid position and try to correct after doubleclick if vid is url
        (long-term soln is apative dling plan)

[ ] narrow down what dlls we actually need?




as it comes up / later:

[ ] test the new timeout on loading urls if connection is flaky

[ ] add proper random lib

[ ] playlist support
    [ ] drop in folder
    [ ] drop in text file list / string list
    [ ] yt playlist
    [ ] autoplay (yt+others?)
    [ ] view to-play list somehow
    [ ] re-arrange / shuffle / random

[ ] improve video resize quality (compare to vlc eg)
    [x] start with variable-size ffmpeg to screen buffer?
    [ ] sharpen filter?


bugs inherent to rendering on the sys msg loop thread:
[ ] click and drag a little bit, then hold, freezes render 
    (impossible to avoid with sys render i think)



----bigger projects----


--CODEC_CAP_DELAY thing--

[ ] handle these example cases with CODEC_CAP_DELAY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUWur-T598s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZo1BLYcMJ4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH4NrUxcsYs
    [ ] check if there is any data or it's just the flag is set
    [ ] use the remaining data if there
    [ ] or replace with new send/receive api which i don't think needs a special case for this

[ ] intermittent repeat-frame loop? maybe after seeking?
    -happened in dutch and manups and brick.. is it maybe a CODEC_CAP_DELAY thing?


--code cleanup--
[ ] api/naming improvements
    [ ] window class "glass"
    [ ] movie decoder "projector"

[ ] file conventions
    [ ] menu
    [ ] sdl
    [ ] etc

[ ] limited to singleton usage
    [ ] glass
    [ ] menu
    [ ] others?


--dl buffering--
[ ] dl low qual first (faster seeking / faster start)
[ ] dl multiple quality versions in background? (adaptively improve quality?)
[ ] dl entire file in background? (faster seeking / what about very large files?)


--rendering improvements--
[ ] batch quads for one draw call (fix the not-too-terrible flicker on resize with debug text?)

---low priority----


[ ] opacity doesn't seem to work in wallpaper mode, but not really wanted too badly anyway
    could maybe do something funny with workerW to get it to work, 
    since workerW is originally for fading between wallpapers

[/] lose transparency on full screen
    [x] temp workaround by keeping 1 pixel smaller than monitor size
    [/] problem is we now have to be set topmost when fullscreen to get over the taskbar
        [x] set and unset when toggling fullscreen
        [ ] "back way" into fullscreen maybe iffy.. eg wallpaper->fullscreen->nonwallpaper

[ ] more than one audio stream
[?] more than one video stream??
    [x] give us a message if we ever see these
    [ ] just get a big collection of different videos to test at some point

[ ] check for small mem leaks
    [ ] on loading
    [ ] on continuous run 



---consider-----

overlay display: icon/bitmaps (esp play/pause)?

step forward and backwards by a single frame?

manual crop by resize borders but keeping window same? 
maybe with middle mouse button
and track with middle mouse, like a pdf or something

when playing url...
..d/l asyn high quality
..play low quality instantly, switching to high quality on the fly?

replace youtube-dl with homegrown/internal variant?

grown/shrink which side of window based on screen location when changing aspect ratio??

add icon to pause/play menu item

if ghost mode forced always on top, should it also be automatically disabled when leaving ghost mode?

if we pre-process the file in parallel to display, we could seek much faster on files with spaced out I-frames
(and especially urls)


low vid framerate (eg maybe if audio only),
things that we check each loop like if mouse leaves window will feel very slow
their responsiveness is basically frame rate dependent
always update at 60+ and just "render" at video fps?


kind of annoying...
if we are fullscreen ghost mode transparent and disable ghost mode, 
trying to click on the task bar will seek somewhere else in the video
maybe disabling ghost mode should always reset opacity and topmost??
and should it set our opacity much lower too? i guess not


possible for youtube-dl to not clsoe if process forced close at the wrong time? i think so

in wallpaper mode check for clicks on our rect and open menu?
check for file drags somehow even?


---instructions-------

to load a file

pass path as argument
drag file onto window
drag url onto window
paste (ctrl+V) url or path from clipboard while window active
rclick menu, paste url or path
rclick menu, open file... ?



---notes---


debug print these cases--
PTS out of order
any b frames?
repeat_pict?


use avframe repeat_pict ?




fluid buffering----

[xxx        ] time playing
[.....      ] time buffered

two threads 
-1 getting video quickly as possible given what we have and time until we run out
-1 grabbing highest res frame avil for next frame, buffer if none avail


i/o loop
-fast, responsive
-no drops
-animate if waiting for data


d/l / decode loop
-get data asap, even if low qual
-improve qual asap
-ok to wait, esp if video playing, but w/in reason (timeout?)



---fun----

preview random frame when loading while paused

filters!
pixel shaders, eg splash on click
-switch on
-degauss

random a/v mashup

random video [maybe 'i'm feeling lucky' style]

green screen masking type functionality?

if no video, visualize audio

face detection googly eyes? no, that's taking it too far

automatic audio adjust starting volume??
