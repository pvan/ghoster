[/] window controls are laggy on second ghoster window
    this is starting to feel like an nvidia driver bug
    [x] .bat file workaround
    [ ] "launcher" exe workaround?


[ ] test no internet


[ ] set notification popup and window title to video name


[x] when exe launched from batch file, cannot find youtube-dl.exe.. use exe path to build abs paths?


[ ] debug and release build folders?

[ ] alt tab should close the menu probably


[x] transparency slider

[x] command line options
    [x] menu options
    [ ] positioning/sizing options

[ ] overlay display: play/pause feedback, etc


[ ] load urls with timestamps
[ ] copy url to clipboard with timestamp


[ ] percent bar incorrect when seeking some urls?
    [ ] which?


[x] proper fullscreen/pause/unpause behavior
    [x] cache state on first click
    [x] should compromise and pause, like, halfway through our allowed double click time

[ ] opacity doesn't seem to work in wallpaper mode, but not really wanted too badly anyway
    could maybe do something funny with workerW to get it to work, 
    since workerW is originally for fading between wallpapers

[ ] a sort of message system for update loop communication? load video, seek, etc


[/] extra bar on right of some vids
    -fixed but only by using a constant-size buffer

[/] lose transparency on full screen
    -temp workaround by keeping 1 pixel smaller than monitor size


[ ] seems like mem leak on loading files


[ ] needs a few abstraction cleanup passes
    [ ] menu windows
    [ ] wallpaper window?
    [ ] app/plat interface?
    [ ] app/plat inter thread communication


[ ] decouple display from frames decoded so we can decode from network easier? 
    [ ] with caching
    [ ] and buffering

[ ] look into how ffmpeg dls videos -- cache anywhere?

[ ] need to dl a low quality version first or we'll lag on large files??
    (definite delay but maybe not correlated to vid size)



[ ] add black bars when aspect ratio is locked and full screen



[ ] more than one audio stream
[?] more than one video stream??



[x] volume! 




---consider-----

step forward and backwards by a single frame?


manual crop by resize borders but keeping window same? 
maybe with middle mouse button


when playing url...
..d/l asyn high quality
..play low quality instantly, switching to high quality on the fly?


replace youtube-dl with homegrown/internal variant?

grown/shrink which side of window based on screen location when changing aspect ratio??


hide/show menu window instead of creating and destroying?


---instructions-------

to load a file

pass path as argument
drag file onto window
drag url onto window
paste (ctrl+V) url or path from clipboard while window active
rclick menu, paste url or path
rclick menu, open file... ?



---notes---


debug print these cases--
PTS out of order
any b frames?
repeat_pict?


use avframe repeat_pict ?




fluid buffering----

[xxx        ] time playing
[.....      ] time buffered

two threads 
-1 getting video quickly as possible given what we have and time until we run out
-1 grabbing highest res frame avil for next frame, buffer if none avail


i/o loop
-fast, responsive
-no drops
-animate if waiting for data


d/l / decode loop
-get data asap, even if low qual
-improve qual asap
-ok to wait, esp if video playing, but w/in reason (timeout?)



---fun----

preview random frame when loading while paused

filters!

random a/v mashup

random video [maybe 'i'm feeling lucky' style]

green screen masking type functionality?
